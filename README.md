# My Shell 

This is a simple shell program for an Operating Systems assignment.  
Currently, it only reads a line and echoes it. Future steps will include:
- Tokenizing commands
- Searching in PATH
- Forking and executing external commands
- Built-in commands (`cd`, `exit`)
- Single-pipe support

## Building

```bash
make
